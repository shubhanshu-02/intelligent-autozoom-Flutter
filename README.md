# Intelligent AutoZoom camera

This Flutter app demonstrates real-time object detection using the camera and TensorFlow Lite. It uses a pre-trained model to detect objects and draw bounding boxes around them in the live camera feed. It automatically saves the zoomed-in images of detected objects.
